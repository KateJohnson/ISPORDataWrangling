# Data Wrangling in R for Health Outcomes Research

*Workshop For the ISPOR UBC Student Chapter*

**Friday, March 28th 2-5pm**

Room 3340, Pharmaceutical Sciences UBC

In this workshop you’ll learn the fundamentals of getting your data into shape for an analysis in R. The days of confusing square brackets, annoying dollar signs, and endless column references are long gone. Welcome to the tidyverse! We’ll use practical examples from epidemiology and health economics to learn how to filter, summarize, and arrange data, create new variables from existing ones, join datasets together and change their shape, and then, chain all these operations together in simple, tidy code. Essentially solving all your data manipulation challenges. Sound too good to be true? There will also be coffee and snacks.
